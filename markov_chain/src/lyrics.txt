 When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you till you're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking about how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just a touch of the hand
For me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you where I am

So honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And baby we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
Mmm, I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul will never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking about how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll continue making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And baby we found love right where we are

So baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Ohh darling
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And baby we found love right where we are (x2)Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

You can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come homeWhite lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste

Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
She don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Try to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes

Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Cool girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
She don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And we're all under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
We don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly, fly
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly

Angels to dieOh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin sons

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high
Into the night
Calling out father, oh,
Stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side, high

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine
For the last time
Calling out father, oh,
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn over and on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

(Chorus)
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fi-i-ire
Hollowing souls
And I see fi-i-i-ire
Blood in the breeze
And i hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fold and
Surely I'll do the same
Come find in mountain holes we
Got too close to the flame
Calling out father, oh,
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn over and on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

(Chorus)
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fi-i-ire
Hollowing souls
And I see fi-i-i-ire
Blood in the breeze
And i hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning i will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

(Chorus)
And I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fi-i-ire
Hollowing souls
And I see fi-i-i-ire
Blood in the breeze

And I see fire
(oh you know I saw a city burning)
Fire
And I see fire
(feel the heat upon my skin)
Fire
And I see fire
(oooh)
And I see fire burning over and on the mountain side.[Verse 1]
I found a love for me.
Darling, just dive right in, and follow my lead.
Well, I found a girl - beautiful and sweet.
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me.
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love,
Not knowing what it was.
I will not give you up this time,
But darling, just kiss me slow,
Your heart is all I own,
And in your eyes you're holding mine.

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song.
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight.

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know.
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home.
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets,
To carry love, to carry children of our own.

We are still kids, but we're so in love,
Fighting against all odds.
I know we'll be alright this time.
Darling, just hold my hand.
Be my girl, I'll be your man.
I see my future in your eyes.

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song.
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful,
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight.

[Outro]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song.
I have faith in what I see.
Now I know I have met an angel in person,
And she looks perfect, I don't deserve this.
You look perfect tonight.[Verse]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then,
Take me back to when...

[Pre-chorus]
I found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long,
I know I've grown
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to 'Tiny Dancer'
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law in the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night,
I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then,
Take me back to when...

[Pre-chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes,
One works down by the coast,
One had two kids but lives alone,
One's brother overdosed,
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way,
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real,
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill[Verse 1]
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill,
Threw the day-old tea from the cup,
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made,
Memories of a life that's been loved.

Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals,
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink,
Dad always told me, "don't you cry when you're down,"
But mum there's a tear every time that I blink.

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I'm in pieces it's tearing me up but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah, you were an angel in the shape of my mum.
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up,
Spread your wings as you go, and when God takes you back,
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home."

[Verse 2]
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up,
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case.
John said he'd drive, then put his hand on my cheek,
And wiped a tear from the side of my face.

I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah, you were an angel in the shape of my mum.
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up,
Spread your wings as you go, and when God takes you back,
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home."

[Outro]
Hallelujah, you were an angel in the shape of my mum,
You got to see the person that I have become,
Spread your wings, and I know that when God took you back,
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home."I'm gonna pick up the pieces, 
And build a lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down

My three words have two meanings, 
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm
That's raging on

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

Now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall

And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take

And if it's dark in a cold December, I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broke I'll mend you and keep you sheltered from the storm
That's raging on

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And of all these things I've done I will I love you better nowIt's alright to cry even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die cause death the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight hold on
So live life like you're giving all
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say that death's
The only thing you haven't tried
But just for today hold on
So live life like you're giving all
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path

Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tell me your path and hold onSettle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in
Lie down with me
Hold me in your arms

Your heart's against my chest
Lips pressed to my neck
I've fallen for your eyes
But they don't know me yet

And the feeling I forget
I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved

This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love

I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as, the wind blows
So hold me in your arms

My heart's against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck

But they don't know me yet

So hold you close
To help you give it up
